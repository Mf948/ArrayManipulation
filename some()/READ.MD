# Some ()

The method some is immutable and consists of returning a true logical value if there is at least one element that meets the condition established in the function (callback).

This method takes two arguments:

The function that iterates and evaluates each element of the array until at least one meets the specified condition (required).
An object that can be referenced by the this context in the function. If omitted, it will be undefined. Remember that this in arrow functions is the global object.
array.some(function(), thisArg)
The function, which receives the some method as an argument, uses three parameters:

The current value of the iterated element. That is, if it is the first iteration, it will be the first element, and so on.
The index of the iterated element. That is, if it is the first iteration, it will be index 0, and so on.
The array you are iterating over.
array.some(function(element, index, array))
Difference between the for structure and the some method

Array methods allow us to perform algorithms with fewer lines than a for structure, with the same or similar result.

For example, let's do an algorithm that tells if there is at least one even number in an array.

If we use the for structure, we will need a boolean type variable with the value false and iterate until the condition is met. The break keyword breaks the repetitive loop.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5]

let response = false
for (let i=0; i < numbers.length; i++){
    const element = numbers[i]
    if (element % 2 === 0) {
        response = true
        break
    }
}

console.log(response) // true
With the some method we only have to establish the function that indicates the condition to be met for each element.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5]

const response = numbers.some(item => item % 2 === 0)
console.log(response) // true
